            <h1>David A. Wheeler</h1>
            <p>My professional interests focus on computer security (especially in <a href="https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs">developing secure software</a> ), Free/libre/open source software (FLOSS or OSS), improving software development practices, and open standards. I am the Director of Open Source Supply Chain Security at the Linux Foundation (LF) and an adjunct professor in the George Mason University (GMU) Department of Computer Science.</p>

        <h3>Mentions</h3>
        <p>I've been mentioned way too many times in various news articles and such to even try to give a complete listing. Here is a sampler.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Despite Trump, Silicon Valley’s Pentagon Ties Stay Strong", Jeremy Hsu, Wired, 2017-02-10</li>
            <li>"Still more vulnerabilities in bash? Shellshock becomes whack-a-mole" (Ars Technica) by Sean Gallagher (2014-09-26) is an article summarizing my statements about the shellshock vulnerability.</li>
            <li>I've been thanked by various folks for my suggestions, such as for my XML expertise while participating in the development of the Open Document standard, and by Eric S. Raymond for contributing "many perceptive criticisms and some case-study material, especially in the design" in his book The Art of Unix Programming.</li>
            <li>The article Getting FUD Up? Get The Facts by Matt McKenzie praises my article Why Open Source Software / Free Software (OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers!, saying it's a "jaw-dropping essay" and is "the best compilation of [quantitative] data I've ever seen to support the use of open-source software."</li>
            <li>Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols' "HP Releases Multi-level Security Services for RHEL5" (01-NOV-2007) cites me as an expert on the relationship between open source software and security.</li>
            <li>Bruce Schneier's article "Countering 'Trusting Trust'" describes my security work that counters the "trusting trust" attack.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Presentation and teaching</h3>
        <p>See my page on presentations if you want to learn about my past or future public presentations. I teach part-time at George Mason University, where I'm an adjunct professor in their Department of Computer Science; if you need to email me in that capacity, use the GMU address dwheele4 (at) gmu (dot) edu instead.</p>
        <h3>Hobbies/Personal Info</h3>
        <p>My hobbies include tabletop role-playing games (mostly D&D), chess, singing (bass), and reading (especially science fiction and fact). I also play the piano, guitar, tuba, and baritone horn, though never at the same time. I live in Northern Virginia, near Washington, DC. I'm a Christian; more information about Christianity is available.</p>
        <h3>Other Stuff</h3>
        <p>In the mid-1980s I was the maintainer of Scepter of Goth. This was the first commercial multiplayer Role-Playing Game (RPG) in the United States; I think it was the first in the world, though that depends on how you date the commercialization of Scepter and of Bartle's MUD / British Legends. This was before Internet access was widespread; Scepter was a franchise operation, with each franchise running in a local area (customers would dial into a local franchise). Scepter has influenced many later systems, including many of the multi-million-dollar Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPGs) of today. I haven't been in that business for many years, but people still remember me for that.</p>
        <p>For many years I worked at the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA); I started as a consultant in 1987, becamae a research staff member (RSM) not long afterwards, and ended my full-time employment there on 2020-03-31.</p>
        <h3>Why the middle initial ("A.")?</h3>
        <p>I always use my middle initial in anything written (including information on the web), because there are a number of other David Wheelers. For example, David John Wheeler (now deceased) was the creator of the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) (a somewhat popular encryption algorithm unencumbered by patents), and is credited with co-inventing the subroutine. David E. Wheeler is President of Kineticode, a content management and software development consulting company based in Portland, and is the lead developer for Bricolage (an OSS/FS content management system); you can contact him using the address "david" at justatheory dot com.

            Note: the Associated Press (AP) Style guide recommends that you include my middle initial in this case. The AP Style guide says to "use middle initials in full name reference only if the person uses it regularly" - and I do use my middle initial regularly.</p>
            <h3>Other sites</h3>
            <p>You can find me on other sites such as LinkedIn, GitHub (david-a-wheeler), GitLab (david-a-wheeler), Twitter (drdavidawheeler), Mastodon infosec.exchange (davidawheeler). Hacker News from Y Combinator (dwheeler), and Youtube (drdavidawheeler).</p>
            <h3>Biographies</h3>
            <h3>My typical bio, if you need it...</h3>
            <p>Dr. David A. Wheeler is an expert on developing secure software and on open source software. His works include Software Inspection: An Industry Best Practice, Ada 95: The Lovelace Tutorial, Secure Programming HOWTO, Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling (DDC), Why Open Source Software / Free Software (OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers!, and How to Evaluate OSS/FS Programs.</p>
            <p>Here's a longer OSS-specific biography:</p>
            <p>Dr. David A. Wheeler is an expert on open source software (OSS) and on developing secure software. His works on developing secure software include "Secure Programming HOWTO", the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Secure Software Development Fundamentals Courses, and "Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling (DDC)". He also helped develop the 2009 U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) policy on OSS. Other works of his include "Software Inspection: An Industry Best Practice" and "Ada 95: The Lovelace Tutorial".</p>
            <p>David A. Wheeler is the Director of Open Source Supply Chain Security at the Linux Foundation and teaches a graduate course in developing secure software at George Mason University (GMU). Dr. Wheeler has a PhD in Information Technology, a Master's in Computer Science, a certificate in Information Security, a certificate in Software Engineering, and a B.S. in Electronics Engineering, all from George Mason University (GMU). He is a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). He lives in Northern Virginia.</p>
